# Neural_Collaborative_Filtering_Movie_Recommendation

📚 Project Description:
This project explores movie recommendation systems using deep learning. By predicting user ratings, we determine the best movies for individual users. 

🌟 Key Aspects of the Project:
- Classification and Prediction: Personalized recommendations based on user and movie ratings.
- Matrix Factorization: Traditional baseline method.
- Neural Collaborative Filtering: Advanced method using deep learning.
- Embedding Concatenation: Enhances recommendation accuracy with user and item embeddings.
- Evaluation Metrics: Mean absolute error (MAE), Discounted Cumulative Gain (DCG), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).
  
🔍 Methodology:
- Data Collection and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, normalizing ratings, and creating a user-item interaction matrix.
- Matrix Factorization: SVD to factorize the interaction matrix and predict ratings.
- Neural Collaborative Filtering: Dense vectors for users and items, multiple hidden layers, and a final output layer.
  
📊 Model Training and Evaluation:
- Metrics: MAE for prediction accuracy, DCG and NDCG for ranking quality.
  
📈 Results and Discussion:
- Matrix Factorization: Simple, scalable, but less effective with complex interactions.
- Neural Collaborative Filtering: More accurate, flexible, but computationally expensive.
  
🔄 Comparative Analysis:
- Performance: Neural collaborative filtering shows better accuracy and quality.
- Scalability: Matrix factorization scales better but is less effective with sparse data.
- Complexity: Neural collaborative filtering is more complex and resource-intensive.
  
🚀 Future Work:
- Hybrid Models: Combining strengths of both approaches.
- Context-Aware Recommendations: Including contextual information.
- Transfer Learning: Using pre-trained models for sparse data.
- Explainability: Making recommendations more interpretable.
- Real-Time Recommendations: Updating models based on real-time user interactions.
